    <p>In the very first session i learned about the syntax,readlinesync,how to print the something in javaScript.After clearing all the basics i got to know about the functions,if-else statement,for loops,arrays,objects etc.Then by clubbing all the concept which i learned i applied those in one go & created my very first app.How well do you know me?</p>
