    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>Few days back i was scrolling my linkedin & one of my friend liked the post of Tanay Pratap then i started following him.From a Non-CS background i doubted that if web-development for me or not but i got so motivated after started watching level-Zero lectures that i can also do programming i can also create my own apps & websites.I just want to gain the knowledge & skills which everyone was learning from his sessions.</p>
</div>

<ul class="container-center">
    <h2>Technologies i learned</h2>
    <li>NodeJS</li>
    <li>ReactJS</li>
    <li>CHALK</li>
    <li>Repl</li>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
</ul>
    <div class="container-center">
    <h2>App making</h2>
    <p>In the very first session i learned about the syntax,readlinesync,how to print something in <strong>JavaScript</strong>.After clearing all the basics i got to know about the functions,if-else statement,for loops,arrays,objects etc.Then by clubbing all the concept which i learned i applied those in one go & created my very first app.How well do you know me?</p>
    <p>After going through all the lectures i learnt alot i.e- creating my own portfolio the best practrices to use.e.g - using BEM convention, to create any project always layout the HTML first,promises etc. I had created total 11 hands on practice projects which contains a lot of concepts fo any beginner to start his/her web dev journey.</p>
    
    <p>While making these projects also face a lot of errors which was nothing but to look with patience what error was thrown into the console. One them was like - i forgot to typecast in one of my project & it shows wrong results on the screen even when everything was working fine. I struggled alot with the CSS it seems quite difficult for me to center anything on a web-page i learnt some CSS property known as "flex" which is super easy if you want to center anything on your page you just need to give your container display propery as flex i.e-  display: "flex", align-items: "center" , justify-content: "center". So if you also stuck with these weird errors just have patience & look carefully into your code you will find out.</p>

    <h2>Website hosting</h2>
    <p>Hosting your website is super easy today there are number of platform which let you host website free of cost viz - Netlify, Vercel & many more.
            To host your website you just need to have a github account account in which all your personal information & projects repositories are stored.
            You just need to sign-up on netlify & link your github account with that after successfull login you will see there various option from where & which repositories you want to host your website just select that repository & branch. sshhhhhh!! just within couple of seconds your website will be online with a random name (you can change that according to your convenience).
    </p>
    <h2>Steps for hosting:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1-Sign-up on Github</li>
        <li>2-Push all your code from local machine to Github</li>
        <li>3-Sign-up on netlify</li>
        <li>4-Link your Github profile to netlify</li>
        <li>5-Select the repo you want to host</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It then takes few seconds to live your website.After that you can change or set the URL of your website manually which is of your choice.</p>
    <p>Lastly, i would like to thanks tanay for making this levelZero so easy to learn in the best possible way.</p>
