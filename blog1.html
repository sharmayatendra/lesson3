    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>Few days back i was scrolling my linkedin & one of my friend liked the post of Tanay Pratap then i started following him.I got so motivated that i can also do programming i can also create my own apps & websites.I just want to gain the knowledge & skills which everyone was learning from his sessions.</p>
</div>

<ul class="container-center">
    <h2>Technologies i learned</h2>
    <li>NodeJS</li>
    <li>ReactJS</li>
    <li>CHALK</li>
    <li>Repl</li>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
</ul>
    <div class="container-center">
    <h2>App making</h2>
    <p>In the very first session i learned about the syntax,readlinesync,how to print something in <strong>JavaScript</strong>.After clearing all the basics i got to know about the functions,if-else statement,for loops,arrays,objects etc.Then by clubbing all the concept which i learned i applied those in one go & created my very first app.How well do you know me?</p>
    <p>After going through all the lectures i learnt alot i.e- creating my own portfolio the best practrices to use.e.g - using BEM convention, to create any project always layout the HTML first etc. I had created total 11 hands on practice projects which contains a lot of concepts fo any beginner to start his/her web dev journey</p>
    <p>While making these projects also face a lot of errors which was nothing but to look with patience what error was thrown into the console. One them was like - i forgot to typecast in one of my project & it shows wrong results on the screen even when everything was working fine. So if you also stuck with these weird errors just have patience & look carefully into your code you will find out.</p>
    <p>Lastly, i would like to thanks tanay for making this levelZero so easy to learn in the best possible way.</p>
